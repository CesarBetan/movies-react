# Getting Started with Shows DB

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a challenge project of a movies website developed with ReactJS for SkydropX Developer Challenges.
It displays movies with the categories of popular, now playing and top rated, with the possibilities of viewing a glance in the home page or in more detail. You can choose a movie and see a detailed description of the movie and recommendations based on the movie chosen. The user can add and remove any movie to favorites in the detailed description of the movie, this will be stored in the local storage to mantain persitency, and the user has a view which shows all the current favorite shows saved by the user.
